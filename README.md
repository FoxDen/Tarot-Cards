# Tarot-Cards
Cute little tarot card reader I made since I have no tarot deck and have always kind of wanted to have one...Uploaded to Github.

I can't use tarot card descriptions without permission, and have not been able to acquire permission--so no web scraping, unfortunately. I will be commenting out those sections involving the code there but will not be removing them, as that is not covered by copywright. What I can get, I will get from Wikipedia.
