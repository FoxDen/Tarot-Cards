# Tarot-Cards
Cute little tarot card reader I made since I have no tarot deck and have always kind of wanted to have one...Uploaded to Github.

The website I used is called Paranormality,com, an occult-themed index and reference source. I don't claim anything from it, simply using it as a reference point! I am also grateful to the authors.
