# Tarot-Cards
Cute little tarot card reader I made since I have no tarot deck and have always kind of wanted to have one...Uploaded to Github.

I can't use tarot card descriptions without permission, and have not been able to acquire permission--so no web scraping, unfortunately. There is a uncopyrighted version of the meanings which I will be using to generate the meanings, sourced from Mark McElroy.
